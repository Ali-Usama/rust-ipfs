HTTP api on top of `ipfs` crate. The end binary has some rudimentary ipfs CLI
functionality but mostly in the aim of testing the `rust-ipfs` via:

 * [conformance](../conformance)
 * [interop](https://github.com/rs-ipfs/interop/)

HTTP specs:

 * https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/http/api/

Status: Pre-alpha, most of the functionality is missing or `501 Not
Implemented`. See the repository level README for more information.
